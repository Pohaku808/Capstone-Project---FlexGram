<h3>📌 Introduction</h3>

FlexGram is a health and fitness-focused social media web application designed to foster a community around healthy living. Users can share recipes, workout content, health tips, and track macronutrients with a built-in macro counter. Our goal: one platform to empower users on their journey to better health.
