<h3>üõë Risks & Mitigation</h3>

- During our project proposal the team identified any potential risks that team may encounter and are meant to be addressed and managed throughout the project's implementation. 
- Below is a table with the risks that was found during the project's proposal phase:

| Risk                             | Resolution                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Difficulty with responsive UI    | Practiced Bootstrap, explored responsive design. |
| Trouble with AJAX                | Research and practice using AJAX                 |
| Front end development may be lacking | Research and practice more with CSS and JavaScript|
| Pie chart visualization          | Learn how to implement Chart.js                  |
| ASP.NET Core Identity errors     | Alternative custom authentication approach (ex. Cookie-based Authentication)|
